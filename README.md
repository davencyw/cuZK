# cuZK - Various Zero-Knowledge Relevant Implementations in C++ and CUDA

An educational C++ and CUDA implementation of zero-knowledge cryptography primitives, designed for learning and understanding ZK-proof systems.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning

**This implementation is for educational purposes only and should not be used in production environments.**

For example, the MDS matrix and round constants generation must be replaced with secure, spec-compliant algorithms if this is meant for cryptographic purposes.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

**The author does not guarantee the correctness of any implemented algorithms.** This code is provided as-is for educational and research purposes. If you discover any errors, inconsistencies, you can report them by opening an issue on the project repository.
